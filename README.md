# layout-task
Recreating a web page via HTML / CSS / JS for test-task. Design of the web page was changed (style of buttons mainly). The web page supports Google Chrome browser. The web page is adapted for big and small screens (from 400px and more).

## What I have done:
1. Changed logo and images.
2. Recreated web-page own HTML/CSS.
3. Changed button styles.
4. The web page is mobile friendly.

## What should be improved:
1. Implementation of filtering in JS.

## Suggestions about what to do next
1. Integration with back-end and getting information more dinamic way.
2. Divide code of application into several components.
3. Implementation of supporting other browsers.
